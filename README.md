# TalkTour---Multilingual-Hotel-Concierge-Bot
TalkTour: An AI-driven multilingual concierge bot designed to simplify travel for international tourists in India. By bridging language gaps through real-time translation, users can book local transport, find top-rated stays, and explore Indian heritage in their native tongue. Built for the ACM KLH Hackathon to empower global explorers.

The Tech Stack: Even though the file is HTML, mention the Python/LLM/Translation API backend you planned in the problem statement.

Key Problem Solved: Explicitly state that this addresses the "accessibility gap" for non-English/non-Hindi speaking tourists.

Scalability: Mention that the architecture allows for easy addition of more Indian states and service APIs (like Uber or IRCTC).
